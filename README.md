COP290 - Design Practices

## Subtask1: Camera angle correction and frame cropping
### Goals:
- Convert the images to grayscale.
- Add mouseclick functionality for selecting corresponding points.
- Perform projecting and cropping using OpenCV functions.
- Use the previously selected points to transform the image ```traffic.jpg```.

### Execute:
```
$ make
```
An image in greyscale will appear on the screen.\
Click on the four points you want to use for projection, starting from the top-left corner, in a clockwise manner. \
Then press ```Enter```.
